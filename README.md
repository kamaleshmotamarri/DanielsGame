A time-travel puzzle adventure game where you fix anomalies across history.

Made for BPA Software Engineering 2025-2026.
Manual:
Project Overview: In Chronoquestions, the player is Agent Zero the chrono guardian tasked with fixing a broken timeline. They progress through historically themed levels and also collect fragments. This project shows real time physics, rendering, management, and audio synthesis. We also incorporated object oriented JavaScript Design and UI system. 
System requirements:A modern web browser such as google chromse or firefox, etc. A keyboard, and also no internet connection is required after the download. 
Installation and execution instructions: You can first either run it locally and download the repository or the file chronoquest_final.html. You can then locate it on your computer, double click it, then open on any modern web browser. You could etiher run it on github pages too if you host it on there.
Game controls: Left arrow or A for left, D or right arrow for right, Jump is W or space, Time slow is shift, Time rewind is R, and pause and resume is ESC or escape. 
Core features: Time manipulation system with time slow, time rewind, and also energy management. Physics and movement include gravity based platforming and double jump mechanics along with moving platforms and collisions. We also incoropoarted enemies and harzards with walking enemies and also spikes. We also added visual audio effects and particle system, screen shake, and animated user interface. 
Level progression: Game contains five levels, each showing different era. There is prehisotric, medieval, industrial, and future era, along with the temporal nexus or the final boss. 
Scoring System: Our scoring system has players earn points based on level completion, time remaining, and also collectibles obtained. 
Technical Overview: Rendering HTML5 <canvas> using 2D context. We also use some Vanilla Javascript. Our Architecture was modeular for system, players, UI, and levels. Our game loop used delta time updates. Our State management used centralized controlled and featured many controls and more. Our audio used sound synthesis. 
File Structure: Chronoquest_final.html.
Our project aligns with bpa demands and requirements and objectives.
